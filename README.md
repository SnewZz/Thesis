# Thesis

This folder contains my contribution for my thesis on the investigation of Fairness in Ranking Algorithms through Interpretable Machine Learning Techniques and on the interpretation of choices of ML with counterfactual explanations. 

You can find some of my contribution in the documentation and cleaning of a pre-existing github repository in the previous_work folder.
