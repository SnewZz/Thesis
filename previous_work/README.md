### Installation

***

As presented in the previous section, several technologies have been used in this repository : Jupyter Notebook and Python 3.9. So first make sure that you have these technologies on your computer. After that there is a list of several python modules, it is possible to install them one by one via pip, but it is also possible to use the pip_requirements.txt file or the Pipfile to install all this automatically as well as the right version of these technologies to be sure to be able to launch the project correctly. 

The pip_requirements.txt is a plain text file that lists the Python packages and their versions, you can use it like this : 

<code> pip install -r pip_requirements.txt </code>

The Pipfile is a more modern way to manage the Python dependencies, these ones are presented in a human-readable format. You first need to have pipenv that you can download like this : 

<code> pip install pipenv </code>

Then you can use the Pipfile like this : 

<code> pipenv install </code>

### Content
***
- The dice_ext folder : This one contains the necessary [DiCE library](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE) to use this project. 
- The explainability folder : TODO
- The models folder : This folder contains the different models that were used for the experiments performed in this repository. It is possible to easily load them to use them in the different strategies presented in the notebooks folder. It is also possible to recreate them thanks to the notebooks.
- The notebooks folder : This folder contains all the code for the strategies implemented, the code for the different plots representing the experiment, ...
    - The plots folder : This folder contains some of the plots generated by the notebook in the .pdf format.
    - advanced_plotting.ipynb :
    - basic_plotting.ipynb :
    - brute_force_rec_expl.ipynb :
    - budget_strategies.ipynb : This file contains all the different implemented strategies to choose the next recommendation. See the notebook for further explainations.
    - helpers.ipynb :
    - matrix_factorization_for_rec_expl.ipynb :
    - misc.ipynb :
    - paper_plots.ipynb :
    - pooling_repr_for_rec_expl.ipynb :
    - score_preds.ipynb :
- The spotlight_ext folder : This one contains the necessary [Spotlight library](https://maciejkula.github.io/spotlight/) to use this project. Indeed, as the underlying recommender system, the session-based recommender system based on the LSTM implemented by the Spotlight library has been used.
