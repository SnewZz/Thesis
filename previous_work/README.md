- The dice_ext folder : This one contains the necessary [DiCE library](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE) to use this project. 
- The explainability folder : TODO
- The models folder : This folder contains the different models that were used for the experiments performed in this repository. It is possible to easily load them to use them in the different strategies presented in the notebooks folder. It is also possible to recreate them thanks to the notebooks.
- The notebooks folder : This folder contains all the code for the strategies implemented, the code for the different plots representing the experiment, ...
    - The plots folder : This folder contains some of the plots generated by the notebook in the .pdf format.
